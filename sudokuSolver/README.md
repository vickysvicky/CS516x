## How to run

To run the program with command prompt, go to the directory with both the sudokuSolver.py and an input file. Make sure to have the python packages (numpy, matplotlib) needed for the program to run. 

Run the following command, where ``easy-input.txt`` is the input file name and `0.01` is the bad move probability (if this argument is missing program will default the value to 0.001).

```python sudokuSolver.py easy-input.txt 0.01```
